When you click on a product, its page opens with details and options to select. From this page you can add the product to the cart or return to the product list.

Clicking on the number of products in the cart opens the product page. In it we can see the products that we have in the cart, the options of color and storage that we have selected and the number of equal units. If the color or storage is different, it is not considered the same product.

On this page we can remove products from our cart, return to the list of products and see the total number of products and the cost of all of them.
